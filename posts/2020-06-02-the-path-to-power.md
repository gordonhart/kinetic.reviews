A master-class sycophant to his superiors, utterly disdainful to those who could do nothing for him, LBJ does not emerge as a principled man in Caro's first volume. His most prominent qualities are downright odious: narcissistic, selfish, rude. He is abusive towards his most hardworking employees, cheats in his college election, cheats in his elections to "Little Congress," cheats on his wife, enables his major campaign donor, the Brown & Root construction company, to commit tax fraud, buys votes in corrupt counties during his 1941 Senate campaign (still loses - he didn't buy enough), and drops his public persona as a "New Dealer" the minute FDR drops dead. And this is only Volume 1! Incredibly, LBJ does not even possess the traits that seem to be common among successful politicians; he is a bad public speaker and is not liked by most people, especially his peers. 

These qualities are what make _Path to Power_ a fascinating read. Despite these extreme handicaps, LBJ goes from an impoverished resident of Texas Hill Country to a Congressman with the President's ear by the time he's 30. What is to be admired is a work ethic and resilience that appear unmatched, a genius instinct for politics, and ambition. He's also ruthlessly pragmatic, which is good or bad depending on your perspective. 

Via LBJ, Caro quite literally maps the Path to Power, but it's a path few have the stomach to pursue.
