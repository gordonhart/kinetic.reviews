From time to time I write professionally for Palantir’s blog. On that medium, I have the pleasantly challenging task of translating our R&D team’s impressive technical advancements into impact our government customers will understand. I strive for informative but direct and interesting content. I also have the unpleasantly challenging task of minimizing the amount of corporate speak that tends to come after multiple rounds of legal review. Feel free to provide feedback on if I’m succeeding in that Sisyphean struggle.

I’ve published two articles recently:

- [Safely Modernize Legacy Systems with Palantir Foundry Container Engine (FCE)](https://blog.palantir.com/safely-modernize-legacy-systems-with-palantir-foundry-container-engine-fce-d8900464da7c): A surprising amount of code for critical national security applications - think missile defense - is written in COBOL or Fortran. FCE makes this ancient software 100x more valuable.
- [The Open Standard that Ensures Your Drone is a Major Player on the Battlefield](https://blog.palantir.com/the-open-standard-that-ensures-your-drone-is-a-major-player-on-the-battlefield-138e7e6158c4): In this post written for drone companies, Palantir makes the provocative argument that they’re wasting time on features that don’t matter.
