> As a pioneer I sometimes did endure loneliness, but I have reaped a tremendous satisfaction that followers will never be able to know. (pg. 25)

Prior to reading _Gorillas in the Mist_, I knew little about Dian Fossey save for her status as the Jane Goodall of gorillas and her brutal and mysterious death in Rwanda, likely at the hands of poachers. With her memoir behind me, the most interesting question is not who killed Fossey, but how she survived for as long as she did.

Fossey’s single-mindedness in studying wild gorillas manifests itself in courageous behavior bordering on the insane: escaping from (what was then) Zaire by fleeing to Uganda, kidnapping the son of a prominent poacher as a negotiating chip, destroying poacher traps, confronting silverbacks, and more. It’s miraculous she wasn’t killed by human or animal sooner.

Fossey was a white woman from Kentucky who didn’t speak the native languages and who inserted herself into the Virungas to study gorillas, her only previous experience with the species being a safari. It would be easy to dismiss her conflicts with the locals as ignorance or stupidity of a young woman naively wanting to study charismatic megafauna.

On the contrary, one of the most striking things about _Gorillas in the Mist_ is Fossey’s self-awareness, empathy for the Rwandese, and acute understanding of human behavior. All her actions are motivated by a single maxim: “one cannot compromise on conservation goals within established park areas.”

Here is her excellent articulation of the tension between _Gorilla gorilla_ conservation and the daily survival needs of _Homo sapiens_ in third world countries:

> Foreigners cannot expect the average Rwandan living near the boundaries of the Parc des Volcans and raising pyrethrum for the equivalent of four cents a pound to look around at the towering volcanoes, consider their majestic beauty, and express concern about an endangered animal species living in those misted mountains. Much as a European might see a mirage when stranded in a desert, a Rwandan sees rows upon rows of potatoes, beans, peas, corn, and tobacco in place of the massive Hagenia trees. He justifiably resents being refused access to parkland for realization of his vision. (pg. 239)

That Fossey does not strawman the arguments of her rivals but engages with their legitimate concerns on the tradeoffs involved in conservation strengthens her own position. When Fossey establishes the Karisoke Research center in the existing Parc des Volcans in Rwanda in 1967, she must actively fight the encroachment of not just poachers but also Tutsi clans’ cattle, whose grazing was decimating the vegetation the gorillas needed. Fossey understands the multi-generational ties these families and their cattle have to the park land, but she makes the difficult decision to insist they take their cattle outside park boundaries, going so far as to mix up the herds belonging to several Tutsi clans. This meanuever was so destructive because it “destroyed long-cherished bloodlines between distinct familial herds.” She acknowledges this was a “repugnant” action on her part but defends it on the grounds of law enforcement.

I believe what made Fossey a threat to the poachers went beyond mere destruction of their traps. She possessed a combination of shrewdness and cynicism that allowed her to quickly learn from her mistakes and predict the second and third order effects of human behavior. For example, when one of the chimpanzees she loves most, Digit, is killed by poachers, she agonizes over whether to publicize his death. Donations it generated would likely be spent corruptly by the Rwandan officials, and she doesn’t see the publicity giving her more leverage to pressure the government to imprison poachers. In the end, heart trumps head, and she starts the Digit Fund for active conservation, with any funds to be used exclusively on anti-poacher foot patrols. But when six months later, two more gorillas from Digit’s group are killed by poachers, she concludes the publicity of Digit’s death and subsequent profits it generated for the officials may have incentivized further slaughter. This time around, she refuses the reporters access to the gorillas’ bodies.

Despite this book being largely about the gorillas of Virunga, I found myself significantly more interested in Fossey, a fascinating, anomalous woman. She endured loneliness and solitude coupled with minimalist conditions and long, arduous days that would have crushed most people. Indeed, the initial field assistants sent to her by National Geographic were totally unprepared for life at Karisoke, and many didn’t make it more than a few days. Corruption was rife, and allies were hard to come by. The park guards were regularly bribed by the poachers to hunt in the park, and the park Conservator bartered captured gorillas with European zoos on several occasions.

Against this backdrop, Fossey’s successes in studying gorillas and decreasing poaching are exceptional.
