An excellent introduction to the fledgling EA cause area of existential risk, although the appendices should have been included in the main text, as they contain the mathematical proofs and philosophical underpinnings core to truly understanding Ord's argument on why and how we should care about future generations. _The Precipice_ just scratches the surface on existential risk research, but this summary of the existing literature is a helpful starting point for anyone looking to read more about a particular risk or better understand how they can allocate their time towards mitigation.  

This book is worth reading just to see if you believe Ord's thesis: Over the next 100 years, there is a 1 in 6 chance humanity goes extinct. If you do find his argument credible, it really calls into question how we ("we" being the world) can correct for the fact that we've allocated a pathetically small number of resources towards understanding, let alone improving, these odds.
