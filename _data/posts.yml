    The Gulf War (1990-91) was China’s Sputnik Moment.

    Taking technology is easy; integrating it is hard.

  blurb: |
    Prior to reading <i>Gorillas in the Mist</i>, I knew little about Dian Fossey save for her status as the Jane Goodall of gorillas and her brutal and mysterious death in Rwanda, likely at the hands of poachers. With her memoir behind me, the most interesting question is not who killed Fossey, but how she survived for as long as she did.

    A convincing wake-up call that the military-congressional-industrial complex is so broken that the very survival of America as Americans know it is at risk unless mammoth changes are made in how the Department of Defense defines, identifies, procures and deploys emerging technology, a problem that is as much about organizational change as it is about technological change
