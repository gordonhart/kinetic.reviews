# About

Hello, Kinetic Readers: my name is Madeline Zimmerman, and I started this blog to improve my thinking and increase the discoverability of books I’ve deeply enjoyed. By day I work at the intersection of defense and technology, attempting to strengthen the ever-tenuous ties between Silicon Valley and the Pentagon.

I’m interested in human conflict: what causes it, how we engage in it, and how we prevent it. Expect to find book reviews on topics directly and indirectly related to conflict, including evolution, economics, defense procurement, technology, history, and, of course, science fiction.
