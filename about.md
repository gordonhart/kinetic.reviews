# About

Hello, Kinetic Readers: my name is Madeline, and I started this blog to improve my thinking and increase the discoverability of books I’ve deeply enjoyed. By day I work at the intersection of defense and technology, in the thin margin between the nonintersecting spheres of Silicon Valley and the Pentagon.

I’m interested in human conflict: what causes it, how we engage in it, and how we prevent it. Expect to find book reviews on topics directly and indirectly related to conflict, including evolution, economics, defense procurement, technology, history, and, of course, science fiction.
