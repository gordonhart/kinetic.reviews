# About

Hello, Kinetic Readers: my name is Madeline, and I’ve spent the last few years selling defense technology to the U.S. Government. I started this blog to improve my thinking and increase the discoverability of books I’ve deeply enjoyed.

I’m interested in human conflict: what causes it, how we engage in it, and how we prevent it. Expect to find book reviews on topics directly and indirectly related to conflict, including evolution, economics, defense procurement, technology, history, and, of course, science fiction.
